A Tag Translator for Wikidot Backrooms Wiki, by hoah2333.

## Contributing

After you pulled the project, please install the dependencies first.

```bash
npm install
```

You can preview the output on your computer. This will open a real-time update website on your browser. You can modify the codes, and see the difference when you save the code.

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

After that, due to the adapter of `dev` mode is different from `build` mode, you must build and see if there's any error on your code.

```bash
# build the translator
npm run build
# check the translator on your computer
npm run preview -- --open
```
